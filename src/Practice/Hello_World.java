package Practice;

public class Hello_World {//For separating The name we use _ or $ when we create the class

	public static void main(String[] args) {// for shorter way to write main we can say main+space
//For Printing a sentence or whatever you want to print we use System.out.println(whatever you want to print);
		/*The shorter way for writing System.out.println is syso+Ctrl+space
		 * 
		 */
		System.out.println("Hello World");//the ln next to print means Line and it prints the sentence in the line
		System.out.println("Hello USA");//if you want this message to get print next to the upper message you can remove ln from println in the upper sentence
