//	Math Magic
//	In this project, you will become a magician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you created.
//
//	For you to do:
//
//	Create an int variable called myNumber. Set it equal to any number other than 0.
//	We will refer to myNumber as the original number from now on.
//	Create an int variable called stepOne. Set it equal to the original number (myNumber) multiplied by itself.
//	Create an int variable called stepTwo. Set it equal to the previous result (stepOne) plus the original number (myNumber).
//	Create an int variable called stepThree. Set it equal to the previous result (stepTwo) divided by the original number.
//	Create an int variable called stepFour. Set it equal to the previous result (stepThree) plus 17.
//	Create an int variable called stepFive. Set it equal to the previous result (stepFour) minus the original number.
//	Create an int variable called stepSix.Set it equal to the previous result (stepFive) divided by 6.
//	Let's print out the value of the last step as: "The magic number is _ !"
//	Now try running your code! What number is printed to the console?
//	Now, go back to your code and change myNumber to any other integer. 
//	Run your program again.
//	Is the output the same? 
//	It's math magic!
//
//	Output:
//	"The magic number is _!"
